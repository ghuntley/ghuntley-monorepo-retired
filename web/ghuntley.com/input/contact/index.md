I'm usually pretty easy to get hold of, here's how I use different channels to communicate with people and how best to contact me.

# email

This is the easiest way if you want to say howdy. I usually respond pretty promptly. My email address is <a href="mailto:ghuntley@ghuntley.com">ghuntley@ghuntley.com</a>

# twitch & youtube

Please follow me on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/geoffreyhuntley) and [YouTube](https://youtube.com/c/geoffreyhuntley). Tell your friends, as by doing so you'll help prove that there is demand for live coding and this activity is worth doing.

The stream schedule is maintained in [an online calendar you can subscribe to](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=Z2h1bnRsZXkuY29tX3BjNWo0MjdjZG1sNW81MmVqczE2aG91YmMwQGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20). Past stream recordings are on [my YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/geoffreyhuntley). 

# twitter

This is my primary means of broadcasting things to the world so please follow me there. I do read my DMs and allow them from people I don't follow. Follow <a href="http://twitter.com/geoffreyhuntley">@geoffreyhuntley</a> on Twitter.

# linkedin

I accept connections on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/geoffreyhuntley
) from anyone. I don't respond to interactions or requests from people that originate from LinkedIn unless we have met in person. If you want to catch up for coffee then organise by a medium other than LinkedIn that way I know you have at least at minimum read this page. 
# skype

If I'm scheduled to talk with you, find me on Skype via my email address. For anything else, please use email or Twitter, I keep Skype connections to those who really need to communicate over that channel.

# what i'll definitely respond to

Genuine queries about speaking at events will get a response, even if I can't accept the invite.

# what I may not respond to

I do not do tech-support unless we have a commercial agreement in place. If you want general help per hour of time (whether it's for help on open source, a workshop, training, or contributing), email me for more details. 

If your message doesn't explicitly look like it needs a response or it's vague or not clear what the purpose is, you may not hear back from me.
