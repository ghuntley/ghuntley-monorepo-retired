title: "2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami"

The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami was the last major event that
occurred before the social revolution - YouTube, Flickr, Facebook and
smart-phones. This was also the first major event that provided mainstream
credibility to the blogosphere, before this event consumers turned to news
publications for information.

For the first time ever news publications did not have the info and were
desperate for content, any. TV crews flew into the effected areas and started
purchasing suitcases/video and still cameras sight unseen off shell shocked
tourists whom were too traumatized to remember if they had captured anything.

[Wave of Destruction](http://waveofdestruction.org) was one of the worlds first
microblogs and was for many months the 1901th most visited website in the
world. It was featured in a TED talk as an example of "[when social media became the news](http://www.ted.com/talks/james_surowiecki_on_the_turning_point_for_social_media)"
and how the internet can surpass, or at least complement, traditional news
media – even in terms of delivering multimedia content. 

Blogging has now completely altered how reporters report, where they report
from and who is doing the reporting of disasters. Journalists and aid agencies
are having to rethink their roles the old cosy relationship where aid agencies
gave journalists access to disaster zones and victims in return for a namecheck
is being torn up. Reporters can now get what they need direct from the public
and Aid agencies are now turning their own staff into citizen journalists and
filmmakers in order to get their message across.
