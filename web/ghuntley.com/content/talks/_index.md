Geoff has spoken at community events, large technical conferences, recorded sessions within the Microsoft CH9 studio and delivered online lectures at Xamarin University. Recent talks include programming in a reactive manner, open-source community automation and the importance of financial sustainability in open-source.

He's always thrilled to speak at conferences or user group meetings, or appear on podcasts and can speak to a variety of audiences from non-technical to deeply technical. He has no further talks planned for 2019 but hey, Geoff's always happy to speak - just ask.
