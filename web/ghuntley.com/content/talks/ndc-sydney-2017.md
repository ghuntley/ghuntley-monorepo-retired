# abstract
Knowledge of reactive programming changes you as a developer, makes you better
and aligns your career with where the industry is going. One of the cool things
about reactive programming is that the knowledge is universal across
programming languages. 

When AngularJS was released, people adopted it, and then version v2.0 (cough
4.0) came out and all of that accumulated framework knowledge had to be thrown
away; such a waste. Interesting enough, you now need to know reactive
programming to be an Angular developer - that's what the breaking change was -
the Angular team has embraced reactive programming (RxJS) and IObservable with
open arms. 

If you ever decide to move away from user interface development to backend
development you'll need to know reactive programming as it is the staple tool
of choice for stream processing and event based architectures. Likewise, if you
decide it's time to move on from the .NET ecosystem then this knowledge is
directly portable and can be directly applied in that ecosystem because there's
an implementation for and vibrant community in that ecosystem. 

If you are sick of investing time into learning transitory knowledge - then
this is the session for you.
