This repository is the [monorepo][] for my personal software.

Everything in here is built using [Nix][] with an automatic attribute-set layout
that mirrors the filesystem layout of the repository (this might feel familiar
to users of Bazel).

If you've ended up here and have no idea who I am, feel free to follow me [on
Twitter][].

# Highlights

## Automations

* `.imgbotconfig` configures `imgbot` to crawl through all image files and losslessly compress them via pull-requests.
* `.github/dependabot.yml` configures `dependabot` to automatically update git-submodules in `third_party` via pull-requests.
* `.github/auto-approve.yml` automatically approves pull-requests raised by `imgbot` or `dependabot`.
* `.github/auto-merge.yml` automatically merges approved pull-requests that pass all status checks.
* `.github/cla.yml` creates a comment on Pull Request asking contributors who have not signed the [CLA][] to sign and also fails the pull request status check with a `failure`. The contributors are requested to sign the CLA within the pull request by copy and pasting **"I have read the CLA Document and I hereby sign the CLA"** as a Pull Request comment. If the contributor has already signed the CLA, then the PR status will pass with `success`. Signatures are stored in `cla/signatures.json`.
* `.github/chatops-rebase.yml` when `/rebase` is left as a comment by a maintainer the pull-request is automatically rebased. 

## Tools

* `tools/github-org-members` retrieve a list of members in a GitHub organisation.
* `tools/orbit-cli` a command line interface to orbit.love.
* `third_party/copyright-headers` idempotently add copyright headers to source files with the contents of `.copyrightheader` unless a stub `.autocopyrightignore` is found in the current or parent directory.
* `third_party/licensed` verify the licenses of dependencies.
* `third_party/nixpkgs` contains my fork of the Nix package manager packages which is automatically updated via the `dependabot` automation.

## Infrastructure

* `infra/desktops` contains my nixos configs for my personal computers.
* `infra/homelab` contains my configs for my homelab.
* `infra/homeassistant` contains my home assistant configuration.

## Dotfiles

* `dotfiles/linux` contains my dotfiles for linux computers.
* `dotfiles/windows` contains my dotfiles for windows computers.
* `dotfiles/macos` contains my dotfiles for mac computers.

## Applications

* `apps/pasteboard` your favourite macOS command line clipboard manipulation libraries `pbcopy` / `pbpaste` ported over to Windows and available for installation via Chocolatey.

## Browser Extensions

* `browser-extensions/send-from-outlook-dot-com` a Google Chrome plugin that makes Outlook.com your default email application and provides a button to compose a message to quickly share a link via email.
* `browser-extensions/serverless-to-cgi-bin` tongue in cheek browser extension for FireFox and Google Chrome that replaces occurrences of 'serverless' with 'cgi-bin'.

## BIOS / Firmware

* `bios/seaslic` if your computer is installed with Windows 7/8 by default but you'd prefer to run Linux as your desktop but on ocassion run a single Windows virtual machine under KVM using the activiation credentials within your computers BIOS then SeaSLIC can help you achieve this. As of 6th of Apr 2014 thanks to the excellent work by Michael Tokarev this patch is now integrated by default into Debian which removes the need to roll and maintain your own your own copy of SeaBIOS.

## Services

* `services/cachix-push-daemon.[service|nix]` automatically publish build artifacts to cachix.org so future builds of the monorepository go ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ Available as an expression NixOS but is automatically installed, configured and started as a user systemd service when the developer environment initialises via `de-init`
