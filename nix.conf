# binary substitutes if available. In practical terms, this means that remote
# hosts will fetch as many build dependencies as possible from their own
# substitutes (e.g, from cache.nixos.org), instead of waiting for this host to
# upload them all. This can drastically reduce build times if the network
# connection between this computer and the remote build host is slow. Defaults
